# ðŸŒ‰ Wallpapers

My collections of wallpapers from r/unixporn && r/wallpaper &&
[here](https://github.com/FrenzyExists/wallpapers) and some other sites.\
Most ot them were upscaled to _2k-10k resolution_ with AI. Enjoy! ðŸª… \

__[âœ¨ Also I made a website where you can view them without downloading anything](https://metafates.one/Wallery/)__

## TODO

- [ ] Split into categories
- [ ] Rename each wallpaper into somewhat meaningful
- [ ] Use some proper DB instead of github lol
